# Aalu ki katlian

## Ingredients
* Aalu, 1 large, cut into thick slices ( like 3-4mm?) 
* Water, 1.5 cups (depends on how many potatoes you use tbh)
* Zeera 1/2 tsp
* Oil, 4 tbsp
* Laal mirch powder, to taste (~1 tsp)
* Salt, to taste (~1/2tsp)
* Haldi, 1/4 tsp

## Procedure
1. Put the oil into a pot at medium heat and then add the zeera. 
2. Fry this until the zeera’s gotten a little brown (they’ll start crackling in the oil). 
3. Now carefully add the potatoes and fry these a little as well (~30-40 seconds). They will stick to the pot so be careful when removing them from the side. 
4. Then add the water to cook the potatoes. 
5. Add all the spices along with the salt and leave to cook on low heat.
6. If the water dries out and the potatoes aren’t cooked then add more water.
